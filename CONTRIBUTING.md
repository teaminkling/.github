# Contributing

## Getting Started

- [Ensure you have a GitHub account][join].
- Feel free to open an issue to report any bugs or request a new feature/enhancement.

## The Basics

> Maintainers may push directly to `main` for minor documentation fixes.

1. Fork the repository.
2. Branch from `main` in your fork.
3. Open pull requests (PRs) from your fork's new branch to our repository's `main` branch.
4. The branch should have a short and meaningful name.

Any code must be in American English. Everything should otherwise be in any form of English,
and may be overwritten later by maintainers to match Australian English.

## Maintainers' Guide

### Sprint Planning

We define sprints internally. At the end of a sprint, the team decides whether a release
should be created. The release cutoff is more or less arbitrary.

Hotfixes can be created any time and released immediately.

### Release Documentation

1. On each `git tag`, a GitHub Release is created as a draft.
2. The maintainer must write a human-readable changelog for that version before publishing the
   Release.

Changelogs are for humans, and it should be a human process to perform the release.
