# Security Policy

Inkling Interactive's engineering team takes security incredibly seriously.

Information security and privacy form the fundamental bedrock on which we build all of our software. As such, we take
the efforts of the community very seriously.

## Supported Versions

Only the latest version of our software will be supported with security updates. In other words, patch versions will
only be applied to the latest current version of the software.

This applies to binaries/apps, libraries, and APIs.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please email our engineering team about any vulnerabilities that give an attack path for any users of the
application/library/API.

You may [directly contact our engineering lead][keybase-paced], but please make it clear in the first message that
you're there to discuss security.

If a non-critical vulnerability can be patched by a minor/patch dependency update, feel free to raise a GitHub Issue. It
is very likely we already know about it, though.

If you have a suggestion to generally harden security, feel free to raise an Issue for that.
