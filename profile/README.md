# Hey, gang 🦑

Inkling Interactive is a small interactive media studio founded in 2018. We are proudly headquartered in Melbourne,
Australia, with contributors from San Francisco, Seoul, and elsewhere.

We're adventurous and serious about art and technology; a team with deep-sea spark!

## Our Works 👩‍🎨

Our favourite kind of product is interactive narrative media: games that feature engaging and thought-provoking stories
across a variety of themes.

We also produce other technical and artistic works in support of these efforts, as well as side project experiments
released to the public.

## Open Source 👩‍💻

Any technology-involved project that can be made open source - especially tools - will always be open-sourced!

## Cheers 🙏

Please look forward to our coming works!
